## Information

### themoviedb

A Ruby wrapper for the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/).

Provides a simple, easy to use interface for the Movie Database API.

Get your API key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account).

## Getting started

```ruby

```

Example usage of the 'themovedb' gem

http://themoviedb.herokuapp.com/

https://github.com/ahmetabdi/themoviedb-example

## Configuration

```ruby
Tmdb::Api.key("KEY_HERE")
```

You can change the language for the returned data with this:

```ruby
Tmdb::Api.language("de")
```

The default language is english.

## Resources

Current available resources:
* Company
* Movie
* Collection
* People
* Genre

## Example

```ruby
Tmdb::Movie.find("batman")
Tmdb::Collection.find("spiderman")
Tmdb::People.find("samuel jackson")
Tmdb::Company.find("lucas")
Tmdb::Genre.find("drama")
```

## Search

### Usage

resources => person, movie, collection, company

```ruby
@search = Tmdb::Search.new
@search.resource('person') # determines type of resource
@search.query('samuel jackson') # the query to search against
@search.fetch # makes request
```


## Configuration

Get the system wide configuration information. Some elements of the API require some knowledge of this configuration data. The purpose of this is to try and keep the actual API responses as light as possible.
This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change key map.
To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The base_url, size and file_path. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL. 
Hereâ€™s an example URL: http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/8uO0gUM8aNqYLs1OsTBQiXu0fEv.jpg

```ruby
configuration = Tmdb::Configuration.new
configuration.base_url
configuration.secure_base_url
configuration.poster_sizes
configuration.backdrop_sizes
configuration.profile_sizes
configuration.logo_sizes
```
