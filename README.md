Tmdb::Find.tvdb_id('id')
```

The responses are in the hash with movie_results, person_results and tv_results


## Configuration

Get the system wide configuration information. Some elements of the API require some knowledge of this configuration data. The purpose of this is to try and keep the actual API responses as light as possible.
This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change key map.
To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data. The base_url, size and file_path. Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL.
Hereâ€™s an example URL: http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w500/8uO0gUM8aNqYLs1OsTBQiXu0fEv.jpg

```ruby
configuration = Tmdb::Configuration.new
configuration.base_url
configuration.secure_base_url
configuration.poster_sizes
configuration.backdrop_sizes
configuration.profile_sizes
configuration.logo_sizes
```
